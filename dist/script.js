/* Lay out the page using Grid, based on all of the things you've learned so far:

- intrinsic and extrinsic grid
- number, span, area syntax
- grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows
- minmax()
- subgrid
- media queries

Media queries will likely happen at 500px, 750px, 875px, 1000px. Use a mobile-first approach.

Basic formatting will not need to be changed.

You may need to modify the HTML.
